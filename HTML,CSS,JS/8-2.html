    Diamond doll face, dreamer girl
    With the messed up coke teeth, poppies and pearls
    Wearing in my new cold sweat
    Like somevviewed up, deadbeat, minor threat
    We got the love in automatic
    Bang bang, now hear me shout it
    Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on (Hang on)
    'Cause we got love's electric magic
    Bang bang, it's automatic
    Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on
    Hang on to yourself
    Hang on to yourself
    Hang on to yourself
