My second experience in the IT sphere was when I went to a web-design course in Aducar in 2019. It lasted only three months. But this time was enough to me to learn to work with Figma, Photoshop. 
In this folder I attached a couple of my works in Figma, also Photoshop works have been added to folder named Photoshop.
